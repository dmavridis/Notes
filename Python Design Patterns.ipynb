    "## Types of design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    " - Creational\n",
    " - Structural\n",
    " - Behavioral\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Creational\n",
    " Used to create objects in systematic way\n",
    " Benefits\n",
    "     - Flexibity: Different subtypes of objects from the same class at runitme\n",
    " \n",
    " Mechanism: Polymorphism\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Structural\n",
    "Establishes useful relationships between software components in certain configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "    To accomplish a goal: both functional and nonfunctional\n",
    "    \n",
    " Mechanism: Inheritance\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Behavioural\n",
    " Best practices of objects interaction\n",
    " \n",
    " Focus: Define the protocols\n",
    " \n",
    "  Mechanism: Methods and their signature\n",
    "  \n",
    "## OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "#### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Represent entities in both problem and solution domains\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Tempates used to create objects to avoid recreating them each time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes define objects in terms of ...\n",
    "- Attributes\n",
    "  - Represents properties of an entity\n",
    "  - Captures the state of the entity\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "  - Represents behaviors\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "Establishes a relationship between two classes as parent and child\n",
    "#### Child class\n",
    " - Keeps the attributes and methods of its parent\n",
    " - Adds new attributes or methods of its own\n",
    " - Overrides the existing methods of its parent\n",
    " \n",
    "### Polymorhism\n",
    "- Relies on inheritance\n",
    "- Allows child classes to be instantiated andtreated as the same type as its parent\n",
    "- Enables a parent class to be manifested into any of its child classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Context\n",
    "- Participants\n",
    "  - Classes involved to form a design pattern\n",
    "  - Roles\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Quality attributes\n",
    "  - Nonfunctional requirements: Usability, modifiability, reliability, performance etc. \n",
    "  - Effect on  the entire software: architectural solutions\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Forces\n",
    "  - Various factors or trade-offs to consider\n",
    "   - Manifested in quality attributes\n",
    "    - Unintended consequences\n",
    "- Consequences\n",
    "  - Side effects: Better security but worse performance\n",
    "  - Decision makers: Despite the consequences\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Pattern language\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "  - Should capture the gist of the pattern\n",
    "  - Becomes part of a vocabulary during the design process\n",
    "  - Needs to be meningful and memorable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context\n",
    "  - Provides a scenarion where patterns may be used\n",
    "  - Provides more insights when to and when not to use the pattern\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "  - Describes a design challenge pattern is addressing\n",
    " \n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "  - Specifies a pattern\n",
    "    - Structure: relationship among elements\n",
    "    - Behavior: interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Related pattenrs\n",
    "  - Lists other patterns used together with the pattern being described"
